# Physics-Research-2022
This is the repository of the C++ program I wrote for my Summer Internship through the Summer IE Fellowship Program at Rochester Institute of Technology in Summer 2022.

It simulates a droplet of fluid on a heterogenous surface and utilizes a lot of concepts in computational mathematics and physics to model the real-life effect of surfaces on droplets of liquid under gravity.

The code originally started as written by a previous graduate student (I do not know their name), but the vast majority (basically all) of the code as it is now was written by me.
