# Droplet-Simulation
This is the repository of the program I worked to create for my Summer Internship through the Summer IE Fellowship Program at Rcohester Institute of Technology.

This is the repository for the C++ program I wrote for my Internship in Summer 2022 at RIT. It simulates a droplet of fluid on a heterogenous surface and utilizes a lot of concepts in computational mathematics and physics to model the real-life affect of surfaces on droplets of liquid under gravity.
