# Physics-Research-2022
This is the repository of the C++ program I wrote to create for my Summer Internship through the Summer IE Fellowship Program at Rcohester Institute of Technology in Summer 2022.

It simulates a droplet of fluid on a heterogenous surface and utilizes a lot of concepts in computational mathematics and physics to model the real-life affect of surfaces on droplets of liquid under gravity.

The code originally started as written by AUTHOR, but the vast majority of the code as it is now was written by me.
